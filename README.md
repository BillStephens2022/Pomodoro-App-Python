# Pomodoro App<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description

  This is an app built using Python which assists the user to use the "Pomodoro Technique", which is a time management technique used for work to improve productivity. It is essentially a timer where the timer is set for 25 minutes, the user works on a task until the timer is up, then takes a short break for 5 minutes.  After 25 minutes the window pops up to inform user to take a break.  This (25 minutes of work + 5 minutes break, a.k.a. a "Pomodoro") is repeated 4 times.  After 4 repetitions, you take a 15-30 minute break.  The Pomodoro Technique helps with information retention and keeping motivated.
